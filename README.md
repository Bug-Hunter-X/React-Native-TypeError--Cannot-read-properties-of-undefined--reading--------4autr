# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`. This error arises when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently `undefined` or `null`. This often occurs during asynchronous operations, where data may not be available immediately upon component rendering.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using optional chaining and conditional rendering.
