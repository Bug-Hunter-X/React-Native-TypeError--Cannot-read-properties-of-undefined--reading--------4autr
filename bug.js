This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data is fully loaded. For example, if you try to access `user.name` before the `user` object has been populated from an API call, you'll get a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.
